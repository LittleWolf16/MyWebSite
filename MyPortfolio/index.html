    <h2>The Progress</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2019:</strong> It all started in my first year, on June 15, 2019. I began creating a portfolio because I wanted to make a big improvement that summer. I decided to start by learning how to draw accessories, people, and environments. At first, I drew just for fun and to make gifts for the people I cared about, but then I discovered that I could also earn money by doing commissions or even giving my work away for free. That was my first step into what would become my career.</li>

      <li><strong>2020:</strong> In the second year, during the pandemic, I took the opportunity to start learning how to use Blender. I wanted to bring my drawings to life in 3D. The first three months were quite difficult, especially learning how to use Blender and how to create accessories.
       But with a lot of practice and by watching many tutorials, I finally managed to turn my drawings into 3D modelsâ€”and they looked so much better! I even discovered that I could export them into Roblox Studio, which opened the door to the world of development.</li>

      <li><strong>2021:</strong> The third year was full of wonderful opportunities. As I got more into developing in Roblox Studio, I was able to help test games. One of the most special ones to me was Shopping Wars. I had already fallen in love with Roblox Studio and knew how to use it, but I realized that to make a game 100% complete, I also had to learn coding. I found coding to be both beautiful and complexâ€”something I never expected. I gave it a try, but I didnâ€™t quite succeed. So, I put it aside for a year and focused on writing instead. I found a lot of inspiration in creating stories and funny poems.</li>
      
      <li><strong>2022:</strong> During the fourth year, I focused more on improving my skills and figuring out what I really wanted to do. I experimented with new designs for my meshes and worked on making better animations in Roblox Studio, as the ones I made before felt a bit messy and boring.
       I wanted to turn all this into a clean and organized project because I kept uploading a lot of assets to Roblox Studio without sorting them. This was also the last year I contributed to Shopping Wars, as the development ended for reasons unknown.</li>

      <li><strong>2023:</strong> The fifth year was an extraordinary oneâ€”full of growth and amazing progress. I decided to give coding another try, hoping to finally understand how to use it well. Before the summer of 2023, Royale High held a writing contest, and I participated. After three years of trying, I finally won! I was so happy and proudâ€”this was a huge step toward my goals!
       I also got two commissions: one customer asked for a knight armor for their game, which was quite a challenge because I always want my commissions to come out perfect. Another customer requested furry arms for their avatar, which was easier but still fun to make.</li>
      
       <li><strong>2024:</strong> In 2024, everything started coming together. I began refining all the skills I had been developing over the years. One of my proudest accomplishments was creating wearable accessories like skirts, heels, boots, shoes, and jackets and making them interactive! When a player clicks on an accessory, it smoothly appears on their character. It felt so rewarding to see my designs not only look good but also work perfectly in-game.
       I also designed a special GUI system where, if another player clicks on someoneâ€™s character, a badge viewer pops up showing all the badges that player has earned. It added a new social layer to the game, letting players show off their achievements and progress in a fun and stylish way.
       But one of the biggest highlights of 2024 was winning the Minimalism Showcase contest. After spending weeks carefully designing my entry, focusing on simplicity, clean lines, and visual storytelling, I was thrilled to find out I had won. That moment reminded me how far Iâ€™ve come â€” from simple drawings to full 3D projects, game mechanics, and now even awards.
       Throughout the year, I kept improving my animations, cleaning up my older projects, and pushing myself to try new design styles. I also returned to scripting, and this time I truly started to understand how to make things work no longer just testing, but building with intention.
       And as always, writing stayed close to my heart. Poems, story ideas, little dialogues they all helped shape the soul of my creations.</li>

      <li><strong>2025:</strong> And here we are! Let's see what the future as for usâ€¦</li>

<section id="myvision">
  <h2>My Vision</h2>
  <p>Even though the years go by, I still want to keep learning new skills and hobbies that can contribute to my future career and help make someoneâ€™s dream come true. For example, if someone feels confused about how to start a specific hobby thatâ€™s where I come in! Iâ€™ll be there to show the key to unlocking every big opportunity, especially after someone completes a specific role.
You can always try new hobbies or continue developing the ones you already have, because the real key to the answers lies within you. You can create changes more than you think.</p>
